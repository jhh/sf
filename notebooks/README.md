# Python and OpenCV Notebooks

These are [Jupyter] notebooks containing Python and OpenCV examples. The Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows us to create and share documents that contain live Python code, visualizations and explanatory text.

## Notebooks

The links below will display a read-only copy of the notebook. Clone the repository and run Jupyter locally in this directory to experiment with them.

- [Random Image](Random%20Image.ipynb): displays a random image from the [sample directory](RealFullField/).
- [Basic Image Arithmetic](Basic%20Image%20Arithmetic.ipynb): demonstrates addition and subtraction from image pixel values.
- [Masking the Target](Masking%20the%20Target.ipynb): several methods for creating a mask from a target image.
