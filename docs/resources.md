# Stryke Force Developers Guide

## Python

[Python](https://www.python.org/about/) is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with a simple, easy to learn syntax. It is used by many organizations you might recognize such as Google, Yahoo, Dropbox and NASA.

Python has powerful bindings to the open-source computer vision library OpenCV which makes especially well-suited for learning, experimentation and prototyping.

Best of all, the [RobotPy](https://robotpy.github.io/about/) community is dedicated to developing python-related projects for the FIRST Robotics Competition.

### Installing Python

## C++

C++ is a general purpose programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs. It is immensely popular, particularly for applications that require speed and/or access to some low-level features.

We use C++ for the production code running in our robot control and OpenCV vision systems.

### Installing C++

### Using C++

- [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) : C++ is the main development language used by many of Google's open-source projects. As every C++ programmer knows, the language has many powerful features, but this power brings with it complexity, which in turn can make code more bug-prone and harder to read and maintain.

## OpenCV

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library.

The library has more than 2500 optimized algorithms, which includes a comprehensive set of both classic and state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms. These algorithms can be used to detect and recognize faces, identify objects, classify human actions in videos, track camera movements, track moving objects, etc...
